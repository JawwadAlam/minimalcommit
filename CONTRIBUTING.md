Thank you for considering contributing to Minimal Commit! Your contributions are valuable in helping us improve and grow. 

## Prerequisites
Before you start contributing to the project, here's the prerequisities that you need to have:

1. **Git:** You'll need git to clone the repository and manage version control. If git is not installed, download and install it from [Git Downloads](https://git-scm.com/downloads).

2. **Node.js:** The project is built using Node.js. You can download and install Node.js from [Node.js Downloads](https://nodejs.org/en/download/). Make sure to install a LTS (Long Term Support) version.

3. **npm (Node Package Manager):** npm is usually bundled with Node.js. To check if you have npm installed, run the following command in your terminal: `npm -v` 

4. If it's not installed, you can update it using the following command: `npm install -g npm`


## Local Setup

Follow these steps to set up the "minimalcommit" project locally on your machine:

1. **Fork the Repository:**
To set up a working development environment, just fork the project git repository.

2. **Clone the Repository:** 
Open your terminal and navigate to the directory where you want to store the project. Then, run the following command to clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/minimalcommit.git`


3. **Change Directory:**
Navigate into the project directory: `cd minimalcommit`

4. **Install Dependencies:**
Use npm to install the project's dependencies: `npm install`

5. **Testing the Project:**

There are two ways to test the project:

- **Run the CLI :** You can test the project by running the CLI using the following command:
  ```
  node src/cli.js
  ```

- **Link the Project Locally:** To test the project locally as a global command, you can use the `npm link` command. First, navigate to the project directory and run the following command:
  ```
  npm link minimalcommit
  ```
  After linking the project, you can use it as a global command.

That's it! You now have the "minimalcommit" Node.js project set up locally on your machine, and you can start working on it according to the provided instructions.


To contribute to minimal commit, please follow these guidelines when working on issues:

## Check for Existing Issues
Before you start working on any feature, enhancement, or bug fix, it's important to check if there's an existing issue for it. This helps prevent duplicate work and ensures that the issue is still relevant.

## Create an Issue
If you cannot find an existing issue related to the task you want to work on, please create a new issue. A well-documented issue should include the following information:

- A clear and concise title that describes the problem or feature.
- A detailed description of the issue, including steps to reproduce it if it's a bug.
- The version of the software the issue is related to.
- Any relevant screenshots or code examples.
- Any additional context that might be helpful in understanding the issue.

## Request Ownership of the Issue
If you find an existing issue that you'd like to work on and it has not been assigned to anyone, you can request ownership of the issue. 

Here's how to do it:

- Comment on the issue expressing your interest.
- Mention how you would like to approach the issue
- Wait for a response from the maintainers of the project. 

## Next Steps
Once the issue is assigned to you, it's time to start working on it. Make sure to adhere to our coding and documentation standards. Keep your assigned issue updated with your progress and any challenges you encounter. If you're unable to continue working on the issue for any reason, please let us know as soon as possible.

## Request to Work on Stalled Issues
If an issue has been assigned to someone else and there have been no updates or activity for more than a week, you may request to work on it. This helps keep the project moving and ensures that issues are not left unattended for extended periods.

To request to work on a stalled issue:

- Comment on the issue, expressing your interest and the reason you believe it's stalled.
- Wait for a response from the maintainers. They will assess the situation and may reassign the issue to you if the original assignee is unresponsive.

Thank you for your contributions and for helping us make this project better. Your dedication and collaboration are greatly appreciated!
